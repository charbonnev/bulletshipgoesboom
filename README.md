My entry for the GameDev.Tv Jam 2022

I know it's very basic, and the relation to the theme is kinda loose. But I do think it fits. You have to fail many times to succeed, losing/dieing is only the beginning.

I wanted to include a "tricks" mechanic in which you could win points by making tricks, and create "trick gates": for example, you have to do a double backflip in order to open a gate. Sadly, I couldn't do it it time.
